# Email-validation
I made this email validation project.
It currently validates in general email format. I want to make it college specific email validation. Hope to edit in future.

##To have a look at this project and use it in your local, follow these steps:
1. download emailValidation.html file.
2. Open it with vs code.
3. Install 'live server' extension in vs code.
4. Click on "Go Live' in bottom right corner of Visual Studio Code.
